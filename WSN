Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is one of the most common techniques in different applications such as 
health care, agriculture, factory monitoring and fire track. WSN has many advantages as they are 
responsible for maintaining network paths, data forwarding, and ensuring reliable multi-hop 
communication. Wireless communication face problems mainly in maintaining lifetime of the network 
and its energy. To overcome these limitations we use LEACH (low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy) 
protocol, which is the protocol of cluster routing. Additional, we modify one of the most bulging 
wireless sensor network’s routing protocol “LEACH” as “MODLEACH” by introducing efficient cluster 
head replacement scheme and dual transmitting power levels. MODLEACH, in comparison with 
LEACH out performs it using metrics of clusters head formation, throughput and network life. Later, 
hard and soft thresholds are implemented on MODLEACH that boast the performance even more. 
Finally, a brief performance analysis of LEACH, modified LEACH (MODLEACH), MODLEACH with 
hard threshold (MODLEACHHT) and MODLEACH with soft threshold (MODLEACHST) is 
undertaken considering metrics of throughput, networks life and cluster head replacements.
